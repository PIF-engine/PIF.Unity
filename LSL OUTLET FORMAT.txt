LSL Outlet Documentation and Datastructure:

LSL Gaze Outlet
Description: This outlet GazeCasts and looks for a collision with a word. If we find the word, we send the words location along with what word we hit. If we miss, we send MISSED along with a vector of negative infinity
Stream Type: Unity.VectorName
Poling Rate: Every Fixed Update
Structure: Array of Strings, size 4. (To prevent casting issues, as LSL4Unity doesnt support mixed datatype streams)
[0]: Collider Name
[1]: Collider X value, world space. Not nessessary info (EyeVector gives more accurate results), but is included for completion
[2]: Collider Y value, world space. See note on X value
[3]: Collider Z value, world space. Not strictly nessessary, as it will not change, but included for completion


LSL Eye Vector Outlet
Description: This outlet deals with all datagathering related to the eyes and their directional vectors. It also is overloaded to handle pupil dilation
Stream Type: Unity.EyeConvergance
Poling Rate: Every Fixed Update
Structure: Array of Floats, size  10
[0-2]: Vector that represents the current direction the left eye is facing
[3-5]: Vector that represents the current direction the right eye is facing
[6-8]: The convergance point of the users gaze, projected onto a 2D plane with a normal equal to the reading surface. The origin of this plane (AKA, 0,0,0 on the projection) is the top left screw. This can easily be changed by moving the IntersectionPlane gameObject under the Stand gameobject to the location required. Will send negative infinity if the data would be garbage (AKA, a projection with a negative distance -> a miss)
[9]: Pupil Dilation, normalized with 1.0 being the average value found during calibration


LSL Headset Outlet
Description: This outlet sends all data related to the actual position of the headmounted display. Currently only sends the rotation vector as a quaternion. 
Stream Type: Unity.HeadsetPosRot
Poling Rate: Every Fixed Update
Structure: Array of Floats, size 7
[0-2]: Headset Position in LOCAL SPACE (aka, relative to starting position). Currently disabled due to bugs in the FOVE tracking
[3-6]: Headset Rotation as a Quaternion, with the structure w,x,y,z


LSL Screen Projection Outlet
Description: This outlet sends an x,y value for the users gaze on the physical screen of the FOVE device. 0,0 would be the eyes looking at the top left, while 607,465 would be the bottom right.
Stream Type: Unity.ScreenCoordinates
Poling Rate: Every Fixed Update
Structure: Array of Floats, Size 2
[0]: X value of the gaze convergence, projected into screen coordinates
[1]: Y value of the gaze convergence, projected into screen coordinates


LSL Marker Outlet
Description: The catch-all outlet for all markers we send
Stream Type: Markers
Poling Rate: Does not poll
Structure: A single string, sent when nessessary




Appendix:
Word Collider Name Format, for use in the GazeOutlet
Each word's collider name contains information about the current state of the experiment. Each word is formatted as ({0},P{1})_%w, where %w is the word, {0} is the current choice log (Descisions made by the director) and P{1} is the current page number of the story (P3 would be page three. That is, we have cleared the page three times).
